JCDN_PLUGIN_DESC="<div style=""font-size: 14px; width: 460px; margin-top: 5px;line-height: 21px;margin:0 0 0 10px""><h2>-- PLEASE READ FULL DESCRIPTION --</h2><h4>Terms to know</h4><ul><li>Amazon S3 - This is a storage service that stores objects where objects can be accessed through the web.</li><li>Objects - These are files ranging from css, javascript, images, etc...</li><li>CloudFront - Web service for content delivery that integrates with Amazon S3 to distribute objects through different edge locations.</li><li>Edge locations - Locations of servers world-wide, depending on your location in the world. The closest server will respond to your request, which improves website speeds.</li></ul><h3>Amazon S3 Setup</h3>Before enabling these plugins you must sign up for the following services -<ol><li><a href=""https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Amazon Web Service</a> account</li><li><a href=""http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/subscription/index.html?productCode=AmazonS3"" target=""_blank"">Amazon S3 service</a></li><li>(Optional) <a href=""https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/subscription/index.html?productCode=AmazonCloudFront"" target=""_blank"">CloudFront</a> for a true CDN feel.</li></ol>Once you have created an account with Amazon S3, create a bucket through your <a href=""https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home"" target=""_blank"">AWS Management Console</a>, you can create the bucket in which ever origin server you want, we recommend US - Standard or N. California. Once you have your bucket created, copy the name of the bucket to the plugin parameters on the right.<br />Now we need your Amazon credentials, these are unique to your AWS account. You can get these from the <a href=""https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?ie=UTF8&action=access-key"" target=""_blank"">Security Credentials</a> page, you will need your <em>""Access Key ID""</em> and <em>""Secret Access Key""</em>. Copy those Keys to the plugin parameters on the right.<br />At this point you can start using this plugin, although we HIGHLY recommend you set up <a href=""https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/subscription/index.html?productCode=AmazonCloudFront"" target=""_blank"">CloudFront</a>. When requesting an object from Amazon S3 directly, the request will take on average about 500-800ms depending on your location in the world and the location of the bucket, with CloudFront it will will take about 20-30ms, which is a significant difference.<br /><br /><strong>Setting up CloudFront (Optional/Recommended)</strong> - Once you have enabled CloudFront on your account, you need to Create a Distribution from the <a href=""https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home"" target=""_blank"">CloudFront Management Console</a>, you will create the distribution for the bucket that you previously created, the <strong>Delivery Method</strong> shall be set to <strong>Download</strong>, setting up a CNAME is not recommended at this time as it does not support https requests. Once created, Amazon will create a unique Domain Name for your distribution, you will copy this domain name as is to the ""CloudFront"" option in the plugin parameters.<br /><br /><h3>Complete setup</h3>Change the Cron Job URL Parameter from the Advanced Parameters, to something unique for your website. This is the Cron Job url you will be using: <script type=""text/javascript"">window.addEvent(""domready"", function() { cron_url = location.protocol + ""//"" + location.host + location.pathname.replace( ""administrator/index.php"", """" ) + ""?"" + document.getElementById(""paramscron_url"").value; a_tag = document.getElementById(""cronjob_url""); a_tag.href = cron_url; a_tag.innerHTML = cron_url; }); </script><a href="""" id=""cronjob_url"" target=""_blank"">http://example.com/?CRON_JOB_URL_PARAMETER</a>. This cron job URL should be access at least once a day, but it all depends on the cache lifetimes that you set up. Read here for more information on <a href=""http://www.corephp.com/"" target=""_blank"">how to setup a cronjob</a>.<br />After you have setup the cron job, it is time to enable the plugin! Once the plugin is enabled, browse through as many pages on your website as you can, this will cache all of these pages to the server. Once you are done visit the cron job URL you set up above manually, this will push over all of the files to the CDN, as files are getting pushed over to the CDN, the new urls of the files will be displayed when browsing your website.<br />As time goes on people that use your website will visit new pages on your website and new files will be found, every time that the cron job runs, those files will be pushed to the CDN and then the new url of the file will be displayed in the source code of your HTML pages. <h4>Considerations</h4><ol><li>When using your own domain name (CNAME), CloudFront does not support SSL, this plugin will automatically use SSL if user is on an SSL page on your website. If you have SSL pages, don""t use your own CNAME, use the one given name for the distribution.</li><li>When using CloudFront, the edge locations will cache files depending on their cache lifetime that you set on the parameters, and will not be updated unless that lifetime expires, regardless if you update the file on S3. If you are in need to refresh a single or multiple files, you will need to create a new distribution.</li></ol><br /><br />If you are also interested on saving bandwidth from your host, take a look at <a href=""https://www.corephp.com/joomla-products/jomdefender.html"" target=""_blank"">jomDefender</a>, this plugin will protect your website, but will also minimize the size of your HTML page, which saves you bandwidth as well as helping your website load faster.<br /><br />For any support questions or suggestions please contact us at <a href=""https://www.corephp.com/members/supporttickets.php"" target=""_blank"">https://www.corephp.com/</a></div>"
